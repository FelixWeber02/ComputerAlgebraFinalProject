# ComputerAlgebraFinalProject

Files for Comp Alg Final Project

Includes:
- 2x Sudoku puzzles: one 4x4 (Sudoku2.xlsx) and one 9x9 (Sudoku2.xlsx)
- a .py script to solve a given puzzle and can be run from the command line (e.g. $ run SolverCompiled.py -Type -FileName)
  - Type is either SumProd or Roots
  - FileName is just the name of the file with the unsolved sudoku (must be .xlsx)
  - Only currently works with 4x4, the 9x9 just causes a time out :(
  - Produces a .csv with the output (the format is a bit wonk atm)
- a .ipynb which breaks down how the .py works

Note: you need wolframclient installed for this to work
